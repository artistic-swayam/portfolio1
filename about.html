                             to fuel my imagination and sharpen my thinking. I also stay consistent with 
                             the gym, keeping discipline a daily habit. These hobbies aren't just pastimes
                              — they build the focus, creativity, and drive.

That curiosity soon turned into a passion when I discovered web development. I mastered HTML and CSS, building my foundation strong before diving deep into JavaScript, which took time but leveled up my skills massively.
                        From there, I started exploring and working with powerful tools and libraries like Firebase, GSAP.js, ScrollTrigger.js, Lenis.js, and Matter.js — each one opening new ways to create faster, smoother, and more interactive web experiences.
                        I’m constantly learning and pushing myself further, now expanding into 3D web dev with Spline and Three.js, because this journey is about leveling up, not standing still.
